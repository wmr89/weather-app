# Weather-App

## Description

As a person who is affected by the weather, I want and application that can give me a weather forecast so I can plan ahead.

Building this app gives me the opportunity to learn more about communicating with server-side APIs and using data from those APIs.



## Usage

Navigate to the [Weather App webpage](https://wmr89.github.io/weather-app/).
